# Penguin Pizzeria - Resturant Dynamic Website

As part of our [Principles of Web Application Architecture course](https://www.um.edu.mt/ict/studyunit/CIS1053), Matthew Xuereb and I were tasked to create an interactive dynamic website using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP about a made-up restaurant. Penguin Pizzeria's website delivers the users a pleasant experience with animation to learn about the restaurant, interact with an interactive menu (each dish with its own page), learn about the team and send an email via contact form or a booking form.

Developed with Matthew Xuereb.

The website was created from the bare-bones of the [Bootstrap theme Clean Blog](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/clean-blog/)  and several CSS files.
